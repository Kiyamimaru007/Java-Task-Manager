# Java-Task-Manager

This project was for a capstone project. It is a work manager for a construction company. This program allows the user to add, edit and remove projects from the database.
The program also moves the completed projects to a different database. The challenge here is the database used is in a .txt file. The code had to manipulate and workout 
how to read the data correctly so that it would work with the right projects.
